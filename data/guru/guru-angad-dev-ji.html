								<a href="#">Guru Angad</a> (31 March 1504 – 29 March 1552) was the second of the ten human form of Sikh Gurus. He was born in a Hindu family, with the birth name as Lehna. Bhai Lehna grew up in a Khatri family, his father was a small scale trader, he himself worked as a pujari (priest) and religious teacher centered on goddess Durga. He met Guru Nanak Dev Ji, the founder of Sikhism, and became a Sikh. He served and worked with Guru Nanak Dev Ji for many years. Guru Nanak Dev Ji gave Bhai Lehna the name Angad; choose Guru Angad as the second Sikh Guru instead of his own son. He is remembered in Sikhism for adopting and formalizing the Gurmukhi alphabet from pre-existing Indo-European scripts such as the Tankre of the Himalayan region. He began the process of collecting the hymns of Guru Nanak Dev Ji, contributed 62 or 63 hymns of his own.  <br>
								Guru Angad, (Bhai Lehna ji) was born in the village named Harike in Ferozepur district in Punjab, on Samvat 1561, (March 31, 1504). He was the son of a successful trader named Bhai Pheru Mall. His mother name was Mata Ramo ji (also known as Mata Sabhirai, Mansa Devi, Daya kaur). Baba Narayan Das Trehan was his grandfather, whose ancestral house was at Matte-di-Sarai near Mukatsar. Pheru ji moved back to this place. <br>
								Under the influence of his mother, Mata Ramo, Bhai Lehna ji began to worship Durga (A Hindu mythological Goddess). He used to lead a batch of worshippers to Jawalamukhi Temple every year. He was married to Mata Khivi ji in Jaunary 1520 and had two sons (Bhai Dasu and Bhai Datu) and two daughters (Bibi Amro and Bibi Anokhi). The whole family of Bhai Pheru had to leave their ancestral village because of the ransacking by the Mughal and Baloch militia who had come with Babur. After this, his family settled in village Khadur Sahib beside the Beas River, near Tarn Taran Sahib (A small town about 25 km. away from Amritsar City). <br>
								Once Bhai Lehna ji heard the recitation of a hymn of Guru Nanak Sahib from Bhai Jodha (a sikh of Guru Nanak Sahib) and was thrilled and decided to proceed through Kartarpur to have a glimpse of Guru Nanak Sahib at the time of yearly pilgrimage to Jwalamukhi Temple. His very first meeting with Guru Nanak Sahib completely transformed him. He renounced the worship of Hindu Goddess, dedicated himself to the service of Guru Nanak and became his Sikh (disciple), and began to live at Kartarpur. His devotion to Guru Nanak and his holy mission was so great that he was installed as the Second Nanak in September 7, 1539 by Guru Nanak himself. Earlier Guru Nanak tested him in various ways and found an embodiment of obedience and service in him. Guru Nanak gave him a new name "Angad" (Ang-means from own body part). He spent six or seven years in the service of Guru Nanak Sahib at Kartarpur. <br>
								After the death of <a href="guru_nanak_dev_ji.html">Guru Nanak Sahib</a> on September 22, 1539, Guru Angad Sahib left Kartarpur for Khadur Sahib Village (near Goindwal Sahib). He carried forward the thought of Guru Nanak Sahib both in letter and spirit. Yogis and Saints of different sects visited him and held detailed discussions about Sikhism with him.<br>
								Guru Angad invented the present form of the Gurmukhi script. It became the medium of writing the Punjabi language in which the hymns of the Gurus are expressed. This step had a far-reaching purpose and impact. Firstly, it gave the common people a language that is simple to learn and write. Secondly, it helped the community to dissociate itself from the very reserved and complex nature of the Sanskrit religious tradition so that the growth and development of the Sikhs could take place unhampered and unprejudiced by the backlog of the earlier religious and social philosophies and practices.<br>
								He visited every place related to Guru Nanak Dev Ji. He collected the Bani (prayers) written by Guru Nanak Dev Ji. He compiled the biography of Guru Nanak Dev Ji with the help of Bhai Bala Ji who was present in many of tours of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Guru Angad Dev Ji also writes 63 saloks (stanza) of Bani, which were later on included in Guru Granth Sahib by fifth Guru, Guru Arjan Dev Ji. His first salok comes after Japji Sahib, prayer of Guru Nanak Dev Ji. This salok is very famous and is used every time, whenever the Sikh finishes his prayer or kirtan activity. The English translation of that salok is as follows:-<br>
								<b>"Air is the Guru, Water is the Father, and Earth is the Great Mother of all. Day and night are the two nurses, in whose lap all the world is at play. Good deeds and bad deeds-the record is read out in the Presence of the Lord of Dharma. According to their own actions, some are drawn closer, and some are driven farther away. Those who have meditated on the Naam, the Name of the Lord, and departed after having worked by the sweat of their brows - O Nanak, their faces are radiant in the Court of the Lord, and many are saved along with them!"</b> - Guru Angad Dev Ji<br>
								Guru Angad took a keen interest in physical fitness, and encouraged his devotees to be involved in sports after their morning prayers. Guru Angad Dev ji inspired people to lead healthy lives. According to Guru ji, if you are physically fit only than you can pursue higher goals in life, because a sound mind can exist only in a sound body. He provided opportunities to underprivileged sections of the society to maintain good health. He encouraged all people to be involved in wrestling bouts or Mal Akharas to compete in physical competitions. This was again his way of doing away with social taboos of people of lower caste not having physical contact with higher castes. These steps initiated by him laid the foundation for a spiritually, educated and enlightened, healthy Sikh community, without distinctions of caste and creed.<br>
								His wife and partner, Mata Khivi, is a very important woman who contributed significantly to Sikhism. Mata Kheevi played a major role in enlarging the women participation in the leadership position in Guru’s court. Mata Khivi was instrumental in creating and maintaining the institution of langar, whereby all devotees of the Guru and all people in general, were invited to come and eat together. This practice started initially with Mata Khivi serving food to the members of the community and the visitors who would come to see Guru Angad and it came to symbolize the Guru’s teachings; emphasizing the humanity in every single person and abolishing any innate discriminations. She did her job in a skillful and selfless manner, characteristic of her, and evoked spontaneous respect among the people. Her role in that capacity was unique and revolutionary because women were usually not seen in the forefront of the society. She also made sure that the food being fed was nutritious and wholesome because many who came to see Guru were needy and destitute.<br>
								Guru Angad believed in the service and well-being of all mankind and not just of his own followers. He laid stress on character building rather than observance of rituals and formalities. The path which Guru Angad pointed out to his Sikhs for achieving enlightenment was through service and good actions and devotion and worship of one God. He asked his followers to win Divine grace by prayer, singing His praises, cultivating humility, a spirit of service and submitting at all time to His will. Paying a fine under pressure, does not bring either merit or goodness. Sewa has to be done selflessly. <br>
								Eliminate your conceit and then perform service to humanity, Only then you will be get honor - Guru Angad Dev Ji<br>
								The second Mughal Emperor of India Humayun visited Guru Angad around 1540 after Humayun lost the Battle of Khanua, and thereby the Mughal throne to Sher Shah Suri. According to Sikhs, when Humayun arrived in Khadur Sahib, Guru Angad was sitting and listening to hymns of the Sangat(people came for worship). The failure to greet the Emperor immediately angered Humayun. Humayun lashed out but the Guru reminded him that the time when you needed to fight when you lost your throne you ran away and did not fight and now you want to attack a person engaged in prayer. In the Sikh texts written more than a century after the event, Guru Angad is said to have blessed the emperor, and reassured him that someday he will regain the throne.<br>
								Guru Angad, following the example set by Guru Nanak, nominated Guru Amar Das as his successor (The Third Nanak) before his death. Amar Das was a religious Hindu (Vishnu focussed), reputed to have gone on some twenty pilgrimages into the Himalayas, to Haridwar on river Ganges. About 1539, on one such Hindu pilgrimage, he met a Hindu monk (sadhu) who asked him why he did not have a guru (teacher, spiritual counsellor) and Amar Das decided to get one. On his return, he heard Bibi Amro, the daughter of the Guru Angad who had married to his brother’s son, singing a hymn by Guru Nanak. Amar Das learnt from her about Guru Angad, and with her help met the second Guru of Sikhism in 1539, and adopted Guru Angad as his spiritual Guru who was much younger than his own age.<br>
								<a href="guru_amar_das_ji.html">Guru Amar Das Ji</a> is remembered in Sikhism for his relentless service to Guru Angad, with legends about waking up in the early hours and fetching water for Guru Angad's bath, cleaning and cooking for the volunteers with the Guru, as well devoting much time to meditation and prayers in the morning and evening. Guru Angad named Amar Das as his successor in 1552, instead of naming his surviving son.<br>
