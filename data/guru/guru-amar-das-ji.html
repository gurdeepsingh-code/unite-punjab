								<a href="#">Guru Amar Das Ji</a> (5 May 1479 – 1 September 1574) was the third of the ten human form of Sikh Gurus. He was born in Khatri family. He is well known for the services (SEWA) he did for second Guru, Guru Angad Dev Ji. Guru Amar Das Ji was an important innovator in Sikhism, who introduced a religious organization called the Manji system by appointing trained clergy, a system that expanded and survives into the contemporary era. He wrote and compiled hymns into a Pothi (book) that ultimately helped create the Adi Granth. Guru Amar Das helped establish the Sikh rituals relating to baby naming, wedding (Anand Karaj), and funeral, as well as the practice of congregation and celebrations of festivals such as Vaisakhi. He founded centres of Sikh pilgrimage, establishes Goindval Sahib and picked the site for the Golden Temple.<br>
								He remains Guru till the age of 93, which is the oldest of all the Sikh Gurus of human form. He has a younger brother Bhai Ishar Das whose son Bhai Gurdas was a superb poet and was selected by fifth Guru, Guru Arjan Dev Ji, in writing of Adi Granth Sahib, which later on completed by <a href="guru_gobind_singh_ji.html">Guru Gobind Singh Ji</a>, tenth Guru, as <a href="guru_granth_sahib_ji.html">Guru Granth Sahib</a>.<br>
								Guru Amar Das Ji was born in small village of Basarke, near Amritsar. He was born in a Khatri family of Tej Bhan Bhalla (Father), a local petty trader, and mother Mata Sulakhani Ji. He has four children, two boys and two girls, namely, Baba Mohan Ji, Baba Mohri Ji, Bibi Dani Ji and Bibi Bhani Ji   In his early years of life, Guru Amar Das was a very religious Hindu. He was reputed to have gone some twenty pilgrimages. He has also learnt all the four Vedas. He was already above seventy when he made Guru by second Guru.<br>
								Guru Amar Das Ji had travelled more than twenty pilgrimages related to Hindu religion into Himalayas. He also travelled to Haridwar many times before. In 1539, on one such Hindu pilgrimage, he met one Hindu monk (sadhu) who told him that he should have one Guru (teacher) in his life. After returning from that pilgrimage, Guru Amar Das Ji heard Bibi Amro singing hymns of Guru Nanak Dev Ji (First Guru). Bibi Amro was the daughter of Guru Angad Dev and she was married to his nephew. After hearing those hymns of Guru Nanak, Guru Amar Das was very pleased. His mind was feeling burden less. Then he learnt more about Sikhism from Bibi Amro Ji. He instantly decides to meet Guru Angad Dev. With the help of Bibi Amro Ji he soon met Guru Angad Dev. This event took place in 1539, when he was in sixties. Upon meeting Guru Angad Dev, he was so impressed by Guru‘s message that he immediately decides to became Sikh. He soon involved himself in SEWA (free service). He adopted Guru Angad Dev as spiritual guide (Guru) even after knowing the fact that Guru Angad Dev Ji was younger than Guru Amar Das.<br>
								Guru Amar Das Ji gave up his everything in Guru’s service. He started living in Khadur Sahib, where Guru Angad Dev was living. He used to wake up early in the morning to bring water from river beas for Guru’s bath, washing Guru’s clothes and bringing wood for Langer (free food served in Gurudwara’s). He was so dedicated in SEWA (service) that even at this old age he does every work happily and always thought that, it is his good luck that he has been given this service. Guru Angad Dev tested him many times but Guru Amar Das pass his every test by his services. Result of his services, kindness and full devotion in Sikh’s cause, Guru Angad Dev Ji, in 1552; make Guru Amar Das Ji his successor in this mission of Sikhism, without considering his own son. He is the best example that our mind should be down to earth and we should not have the feeling of specialness in us. Everything in this world can be won by kindness.<br>
								At Goindwal, Guru Amar Das propagated the Sikh faith in a logical and planned manner. He himself visited and sent Sikh missionaries to different parts of India to spread Sikhism. He divided the Sikh Sangat area into 22 branches called Manjis and appointed a local devout Sikh preacher at each place. The preacher sat on a Manji (a cot) while the congregation all sat around the Manji or cot. From 22 branches, name of 16 are given below:-<br>

							He started the system of holding two annual gatherings of his disciples from all over the country. At his headquarters, he undertook the construction of a baoli (a well with a perennial source of spring water) at Goindval Sahib. For the Sikhs the headquarters of the Guru and this baoli became a holy place of pilgrimage.<br>
							Guru Ji strengthened the tradition of 'Guru Ka Langar' and made it compulsory for the visitor to the Guru saying that 'Pehle Pangat Phir Sangat' (first visit the Langar then go to the Guru). Once the emperor Akbar came to see Guru Sahib and he had to eat the coarse rice in the Langar before he could have an interview with Guru Sahib. He was too much impressed with this system that he expressed his desire to grant some royal property for 'Guru Ka Langar', but Guru Sahib declined it with respect. Guru Amardas Sahib persuaded Akbar to waive off toll-tax (pilgrim's tax) for non-Muslims while crossing Yamuna and Ganga, Akbar did so. Guru Amardas Sahib maintained cordial relations with Emperor Akbar. Akbar keeps on visiting Goindval Sahib time to time. Sikhism has a great influence on his mind.<br>
							Guru Amar Das emphasized both spiritual pursuits as well an ethical daily life. He encouraged his followers to wake up before dawn, do their ablutions and then meditate in silent seclusion. His also gives definition of Sikh. According to Guru Amar Das Ji a good Sikh devotee should be, truthful keep his mind in control, eat only when hungry, seek company of pious men, worship the Lord, make an honest living, serve holy men, not covet another's wealth and never slander others. He recommended holy devotion with Guru’s image in his follower's heart. Guru Amar Das make the list of Do’s and Don’ts for Sikh. He want that a Sikh should develop a good personality and always follow the path of Guru. <br>
							He preached against Sati and advocated the re-marrying of widows. He asked the women to discard 'Purdah' (veil). He introduced new birth, marriage and death ceremonies. Thus he raised the status of women and protected the rights of female infant who were killed without question as they were deemed to have no status. These teachings met stiff resistance from the Orthodox Hindus and Muslim fundamentalists. When the Raja (king) of Haripur came to see the Guru. Guru Amar Das insisted that he first partake a common meal from the community kitchen, called langar, irrespective of his caste. The Raja obliged and had an audience with the Guru. But one of his queens refused to lift the veil from her face, so Guru Amar Das refused to meet her. Guru Amar Das not only preached the equality of people irrespective of their caste but he also tried to foster the idea of women's equality. He tried to liberate women from the practices of purdah (wearing a veil) as well as preaching strongly against the practice of sati (Hindu wife burning on her husband's funeral pyre). Guru Amar Das also disapproved of a widow remaining unmarried for the rest of her life.<br>
							Guru Amardas Sahib constructed Baoli at Goindwal Sahib having eighty-four steps and made it a Sikh pilgrimage centre for the first time in the history of Sikhism. He reproduced more copies of the hymns of Guru Nanak Sahib and Guru Angad Sahib. He also composed 907 verses (stanzas) including Anand Sahib. He fixed three festivals for Sikh celebrations: Diwali, Vaisakhi and Maghi. <br>
							Again one more life highlighting point from Guru Amar Das Ji life was the selection of site for Golden Temple. Guru Amar Das selected the site in Amritsar village for a special temple, that <a href="guru_ram_das_ji.html">Guru Ram Das Ji</a> began building, Guru Arjan completed and inaugurated, and the Sikh Emperor Ranjit Singh guilded. This temple has evolved into the contemporary "Harimandir Sahib", or the temple of Hari (God), also known as the Golden Temple. It is the most sacred pilgrimage site in Sikhism as out of ten human Sikh Guru’s, eight have visited here. The present Guru of Sikhs, Guru Granth Sahib, is always in Golden temple. This place is not only for Sikhs but is open for every person who want spend some beautiful time of his life.<br>
							Guru Amar Das Ji collected Bani (prayers) written by <a href="guru_nanak_dev_ji.html">Guru Nanak Dev Ji</a> and <a href="guru_angad_dev_ji.html">Guru Angad Dev Ji</a>. His bani’s are written in 17 ragas e.g. Sri Rag, Asa, Majh, Gujari, Sorathi, Gauri etc. Anand Sahib is considered as the most important bani written by him. It is one of those five bani’s which a Sikh have to read daily throughout his lifetime. Anand Sahib is written in Ramkali Rag. His every bani is written in Guru Granth Sahib (present Guru).<br>
							When it came time for the Guru to marry his younger daughter Bibi Bhani, he selected a pious and diligent young follower of his called Jetha from Lahore. Jetha had come to visit the Guru from Lahore and had become so enchanted by the Guru's teachings that he had decided to settle in Goindwal at a very young age. He only has his granny in his family who was very old. Before death, she ask Guru Amar Das to keep  Bhai Jetha at Goindval Sahib in his service. Here he earned a living selling wheat and would regularly attend the services of Guru Amar Das in his spare time.<br>
							Guru Amar Das Sahib did not consider anyone of his sons fit for Guruship and chose his son-in law (Guru) Ram Das to succeed him. Certainly it was practically a right step not as emotional, because Bibi Bhani and (Guru) Ram Das had true spirit of service and they also had keen understanding of the Sikh principles, so they deserved this. This practice shows that Guruship could be transferred to anybody fit for the Sikh cause and not to the particular person who belonged to the same family of Guru. Guru Amar Das Sahib at the ripe age of 95 passed away for heaven on Samvat 1631, (September 1, 1574) at Goindwal Sahib near Kapurthala, after giving responsibility of Guruship to the Fourth Nanak, <a href="guru_ram_das_ji.html">Guru Ram Das Ji</a>.
