								Sri <a href="#">Guru Nanak Dev Ji</a>, Founder of <a href="#">Sikhism</a>, was born on 15 April,1469 in Village of Rai Bhoi Ki Talwandi (now Nanakana Sahib) in Sheikhupura District of Pakistan’s Punjab. His Father was a village official in local revenue Administration. As a young boy, Guru Nanak Ji learnt not only regional languages but also Persian and Arabic languages. In 1845 he took up, at the instance of his brother-in-law, appointment as the official in charge of the ration stores of Daulat Khan Lodhi, Muslim ruler of Sultanpur. Guru Nanak Dev Ji have two partners in his journeys (udasis) - Rababi Bhai Mardana Ji and Bhai Bala Ji. Bhai Mardana Ji gives 50 Years of his life in the service of Guru Nanak Dev Ji and is believed to have spent most time with Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Guru Nanak Dev Ji birth (gurpurab) is celebrated worldwide on katak poornmashi, full moon day in the month of katak i.e. October-November.<br>
								Guru Nanak Dev Ji is considered as the “one of the greatest religious innovators of all time”. Guru Nanak Dev Ji is respected by every person of the world who believes in God. His famous saying is “Before becoming Hindu or Muslim, let’s become human first”. <br>
								Guru Nanak Dev Ji travelled in all the four direction to spread the message of god like equality, fraternal love, goodness and virtue. His emphasis on considering every person as a one God’s child and all the human beings are brothers and sisters. He also teaches to respect women. He also teaches to save animals and nature as both are the two beautiful creations of god. He always teaches everyone to do hard work in life without any frauds. He says that with lots of struggle we are blessed with the human life so it is our golden chance to attain immortality. <br>
								Guru Nanak Dev Ji’s words and prayers (bani’s) are written in <a href="guru_granth_sahib_ji.html">Sri Guru Granth Sahib</a> (present Guru of Sikhs). His most popular prayer is <b>JAPJI SAHIB</b> .It is the prayer from which Guru Granth Sahib starts. This prayer starts with the word “Ek OnKaar “which means there is only one God. He has also written prayers (Bani’s) like <b>Asa di vaar</b> and <b>Kirtan Sohla</b>.<br>
								Nanak was born on 15 April 1469 at Rāi Bhoi Kī Talvaṇḍī (present day Nankana Sahib, Punjab, Pakistan) near Lahore. His parents were Kalyan Chand Das Bedi, popularly shortened to Mehta Kalu, and Mata Tripta. His father was the local patwari (accountant) for crop revenue in the village of Talwandi. His parents were both Hindus and belonged to the merchant caste. He had one sister, Bebe Nanaki, who was five years older than he was. It was the Bebe Nanaki who first recognizes that his brother Nanak is not a normal human being but a soul of god.  In 1475 she married and moved to Sultanpur. Nanak was attached to his sister and followed her to Sultanpur to live with her and her husband, Jai Ram. At the age of around 16 years, Nanak started working under Daulat Khan Lodi, employer of Nanaki's husband.<br>
								The birth and early years of Guru Nanak's life were marked with many events that demonstrated that Nanak had been marked by divine grace. Commentaries on his life give details of his blossoming awareness from a young age. At the age of five, Nanak is said to have voiced interest in divine subjects. At age seven, his father enrolled him at the village school. Notable lore recounts that as a child Nanak astonished his teacher by describing the implicit symbolism of the first letter of the alphabet, resembling the mathematical version of one, as denoting the unity or oneness of God. Other childhood accounts refer to strange and miraculous events about Nanak, such as one witnessed by Rai Bular (head of Guru Nanak village that time), in which the sleeping child’s (Guru Nanak) head was shaded from the harsh sunlight, in one account, by the stationary shadow of a tree or, in another, by a venomous cobra. This shows that even nature was giving signs that the Guru Nanak was not a normal person but the almighty himself.<br><br>

								On 24 September 1487 Nanak married Mata Sulakkhani, daughter of Mūl Chand and Chando Rāṇī, in the town of Batala, near Gurdaspur. The couple had two sons, Baba Sri Chand Ji(8 September 1494 – 13 January 1629)[18] and Lakhmi Chand Ji(12 February 1497 – 9 April 1555). Baba Sri Chand Ji received enlightenment from Guru Nanak's teachings and went on to become the founder of the Udasi sect.<br>
								At around 1499, at the age of 30, he had a vision. After he failed to return from his ablutions, his clothes were found on the bank of a local stream called the Kali Bein. The townspeople assumed he had drowned in the river; Daulat Khan had the river dragged, but no body was found. Three days after disappearing, Nanak reappeared, staying silent.<br>
								The next day, he spoke to pronounce:<br>
								<b>"There is neither Hindu nor Mussulman (Muslim), but only man. So whose path shall I follow? I shall follow God's path. God is neither Hindu nor Mussulman and the path which I follow is God's."</b><br>
								Nanak said that he had been taken to God's court. There, he was offered a cup filled with amrita (nectar) and given the command,<br>
								<b>"This is the cup of the adoration of God's name. Drink it. I am with you. I bless you and raise you up. Whoever remembers you will enjoy my favor. Go, rejoice of my name and teach others to do so. I have bestowed the gift of my name upon you. Let this be your calling."</b><br>
								From this point onwards, Nanak is described in accounts as a Guru (teacher), and Sikhism was born.<br>
								The main basic belief of Sikhism is to spread the message of kindness, and peace, instead of revenge and spite. Sikhism is one of the most recently formed religions in the world. Sikhs follow the teaching of the Guru Granth Sahib, the holy book which comprises the teaching of six of the ten gurus of Sikhism and some saints and men of devotion. The Guru Granth Sahib is worshipped as the Supreme Authority of Sikhism and is considered the eleventh and final guru of Sikhism. As the first guru of Sikhism, Guru Nanak contributed a total of 974 hymns. <br>
								Guru Nanak’s teaching is understood to be practiced in three ways:<br>
								<ul>
								<li><b>Vaṇḍ Chakkō</b>: Sharing with others, helping those with less who are in need.</li>
								<li><b>Kirat Karō</b>: Earning/making a living honestly, without exploitation or fraud.</li>
								<li><b>Naam Japna</b>: Meditating on God's name to control the five weaknesses of the human personality.</li>
								</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
								Guru Nanak emphasised Nam Japna (or Naam Simran), that is repetition of God's name and attributes, as a means to feel God's presence.<br>

								He also started Langer pratha (free kitchen), which is based on theme of human Equality. In this, people of various castes, religion, race, language, designations sits together to have same food. Even a king or ruler will have to sit on ground with normal people to eat same food. <br>
								Langer was started when Guru Nanak’s father want his son to do some business. So he gave Guru Nanak Dev Ji 20 Rupee and told him that whatever business he wants to do he can do but the business should be true and without any fraud or corruption. He also sends a village man, Bhai Bala, alongside Guru Nanak. So they both go out of the village to do some kind of business. On way they meet some saints. From the younger, Guru Nanak Dev Ji likes the company of Saints or person who only talk about the path to reach God. So Guru Nanak Ji approach to whose saints and listen to them. In between the conversation Guru Nanak Dev Ji came to know that these saints have not eaten anything from the last week. Instantly Guru Nanak Dev Ji decides that the money, which his father given him to do some business, he will use that money in feeding those saints. He orders Bhai Bala to go nearby city and bring ration. And then he made food from that ration and feed those saints. When his father asks about that money, he told that he has done a “true business” as per his father wish. A Gurudwara has been built on that place where Guru Nanak feed those saints named Gurudwara Sacha Suada. And after that Langer has became a very important part of Sikhism. Langer is served at every Gurudwara in the world. The person doing SEWA (free service) in Langer believes himself to be lucky because it is believed that Guru himself come in Langer to eat food in the form of people (pangat). This gives us the message that we all are one, our official posts or our caste does not make us different from other. Even now if nobody has some kind of problem at an unknown place, he should reach nearby Gurudwara for help. There will always be someone for help about asking any question about religion, race, caste etc. That why it is believed that one can easily fall in love with Sikhism.<br>
								Guru Nanak Dev Ji also raises his voice for women empowerment. At that time, women were treated very badly in India. Some traditions like ‘sati’ were practiced by people at that time. Women were treated as a market product or a machine for giving birth to children. At that time, Guru Nanak Dev Ji took some crucial steps against all these activities. His popular words for women written in Guru Granth Sahib are:-<br>
								</p>
								<p class="center">
								<b>From woman, man is born;<br>
									Within woman, man is conceived;<br>
									To woman he is engaged and married.<br>
									Woman becomes his friend;<br>
									Through woman, the future generations come.<br>
									When his woman dies, he seeks another woman;<br>
									To woman he is bound.<br>
									So why call her bad?<br>
									From her, kings are born.<br>
									From woman, woman is born; without woman, there would be no one at all.<br>
									<span color="red">– Guru Nanak, Raag Aasaa Mehal 1, Ang(page) 473</span></b>
								</p>

								He says that we should not say or do something bad about women because without women there will be no world. Many kings, warriors, saints and even god has came to earth only through women. So we should respect women rather than hurting them.  <br>
								Despite the hazards of travel in those times, he performed five long tours all over the country and even outside it. He visited most of the known religious places and centres of worship. At one time he preferred to dine at the place of a low caste artisan, Bhai Lallo, instead of accepting the invitation of a high caste rich landlord, Malik Bhago, because the latter lived by exploitation of the poor and the former earned his bread by the sweat of his brow. This incident has been depicted by a symbolic representation of the reason for his preference. Sri Guru Nanak pressed in one hand the coarse loaf of bread from Lallo's hut and in the other the food from Bhago's house. Milk gushed forth from the loaf of Lallo's and blood from the delicacies of Bhago. This prescription for honest work and living and the condemnation of exploitation, coupled with the Guru's dictum that "riches cannot be gathered without sin and evil means," have, from the very beginning, continued to be the basic moral tenet with the Sikh mystics and the Sikh society.<br>
								During his tours, he visited numerous places of Hindu and Muslim worship. He explained and exposed through his preaching’s the incongruities and fruitlessness of ritualistic and ascetic practices. At Haridwar, when he found people throwing Ganges water towards the sun in the east as oblations to their ancestors in heaven, he started, as a measure of correction, throwing the water towards the West, in the direction of his fields in the Punjab. When ridiculed about his folly, he replied, "If Ganges water will reach your ancestors in heaven, why should the water I throw up not reach my fields in the Punjab, which are far less distant?”. This shows that Guru Nanak Dev Ji also want to correct thinking of people about God and the way to please God.<br>
								Finally, on the completion of his tours, he settled as a peasant farmer at Kartarpur, a village in the Punjab. Bhai Gurdas, the scribe of Guru Granth Sahib, was a devout and close associate of the third and the three subsequent Gurus. He was born 12 years after Guru Nanak's death and joined the Sikh mission in his very boyhood. He became the chief missionary agent of the Gurus. Because of his intimate knowledge of the Sikh society and his being a near contemporary of Sri Guru Nanak, his writings are historically authentic and reliable. He writes that at Kartarpur Guru Nanak donned the robes of a peasant and continued his ministry. He organised Sikh societies at places he visited with their meeting places called Dharamsalas. A similar society was created at Kartarpur. In the morning, Japji was sung in the congregation. In the evening Sodar and Arti were recited. The Guru cultivated his lands and also continued with his mission and preachings. This states that he not only say others to do hard work but himself also does the same. Everything Guru Nanak said, he proves it right with his life examples.  <br>
								Work in life, both for earning the livelihood and serving the common good, continued to be the fundamental tenet of Sikhism. There is a clear record that everyone upto the Fifth Guru (and probably subsequent Gurus too) earned his livelihood by a separate vocation and contributed his surplus to the institution of langar Each Sikh was made to accept his social responsibility. So much so that Guru Angad and finally Guru Amar Das clearly ordered that Udasis, persons living a celibate and ascetic life without any productive vocation, should remain excluded from the Sikh fold. As against it, any worker or a householder without distinction of class or caste could become a Sikh. This indicates how these two principles were deemed fundamental to the mystic system of Guru Nanak. It was defined and laid down that in Sikhism a normal productive and moral life could alone be the basis of spiritual progress. Here, by the very rationale of the mystic path, no one who was not following a normal life could be fruitfully included.<br><br>

								According to the Guru, moral life was the sole medium of spiritual progress. In those times, caste, religious and social distinctions, and the idea of pollution were major problems. Unfortunately, these distinctions had received religious sanction. The problem of poverty and food was another moral challenge. The institution of langar had a twin purpose. As everyone sat and ate at the same place and shared the same food, it cut at the root of the evil of caste, class and religious distinctions. Besides, it demolished the idea of pollution of food by the mere presence of an untouchable. Secondly it provided food to the needy. This institution of langer and pangat was started by the Guru among all his followers wherever they had been organized. It became an integral part of the moral life of the Sikhs. Considering that a large number of his followers were of low caste and poor members of society, he, from the very start, made it clear that persons who wanted to maintain caste and class distinctions had no place in his system. In fact, the twin duties of sharing one's income with the poor and doing away with social distinctions were the two obligations which every Sikh had to discharge. On this score, he left no option to anyone, since he started his mission with Mardana, a low caste Muslim, as his lifelong companion. Guru Nanak Dev Ji died in 1539, in Dera Baba Nanak, near Gurdaspur.<br>
								In his entrie lifetime, Guru Nanak Dev Ji was opposed by many because of his ideas was challenging the evil and false system of worship and living life. Whole of his life he travelled millions of kilometers to spread the message of love, equality, goodness and virtue. He taught true method of worship. He has gone through toughest times like sleeping on roads, just to spread the message of God and for the betterment of mankind.  He was very pleased from one of his follower, Bhai Lehna Ji. So he made him his successor, second Guru, and changed his name from Bhai Lehna to Guru Angad Dev Ji. There are many places in India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Iraq, Bhutan, Nepal, Srilanka which are related to Guru Nanak Dev Ji. Wherever his followers, Sikhs are living they are spreading his message and are always ready to work for the mankind.<br>
