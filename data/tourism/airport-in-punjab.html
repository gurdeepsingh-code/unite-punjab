								Accidents and incidents
							</div>
							<p>	
								On 20 September 2014, An Antonov 32 transport plane operated by the Indian Air Force was damaged beyond repair while landing at the Chandigarh Airport. Upon landing the right hand wing broke off and the airplane rolled over and came to rest inverted, in the grass next to the runway. The left hand wing was also severed and the Number 1 propeller broke away from the engine. This led to a fire break out, but was quickly contained. A few people on board the aircraft suffered minor burn injuries.

								Controversies
							</div>
							<p>
								In 2009, Punjab Legislative Assembly unanimously passed a resolution naming Chandigarh Airport as Shaheed-E-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh International Airport after Revolutionary Freedom fighter of India, Sardar Bhagat Singh as decided during his birth centenary celebrations in 2007. Leader of opposition of Haryana Legislative Assembly, Abhay Singh Chautala supported Punjab's claim of naming it as Shaheed-E-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh International Airport, Mohali as the airport is situated in Jheourheri village of Mohali. Indian Youth Congress started march (padyatra) for naming the Chandigarh airport after Bhagat Singh. People's Party of Punjab members protested against Central and Haryana governments for not naming airport as Shaheed-E-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh International Airport, Mohali.<br>
								In October 2015, Shaheed Bhagat Singh's nephews Professor Jagmohan Singh and Abhey Singh Sandhu and Aam Aadmi Party MP Dharamvir Gandhi alongside Youths from Punjab and several other states, including activists from the tricity, assembled at Tribune Chowk and demanded to change the name to Shaheed-E-Azam Sardar Bhagat Singh International Airport. Columnist and social activist Shivanshu K. Srivastava said that "This is an injustice to the country and its freedom fighters... This practice has reached the point that political parties don’t hesitate to refuse to name locations after real national heroes, choosing political “advertisements” instead." On 17 December 2015, Communist Party of India (Marxist) flayed the Centre and the Haryana Government for trying to name Chandigarh Airport after RSS ideologue Mangal Sein, instead of freedom fighter Bhagat Singh as previous Hooda Government was also in support of naming it after Bhagat Singh.

								Adampur Air Force Station is located in Northern India, 21 kilometres northeast of Jallandhar, Punjab. It is the second largest military airbase of India. It lies within 100 km of Indo-Pak Border and home to No. 47 Squadron IAF and No. 223 Squadron IAF.
							<div class="sub_sub_heading">
								History
							</div>
							<p>
								The base played a crucial role in the Indo-Pakistani war of 1965. On September 6 1965, the PAF attacked Indian airfields at Pathankot, Adampur and Halwara.The attacks on Adampur and Halwara were failures. The Strike group turned back before even reaching Adampur.<br>
								On 7 September 1965, the PAF parachuted 135 Special Services Group (SSG) para commandos at three Indian airfields (Halwara, Pathankot and Adampur). The daring attempt proved to be an "unmitigated disaster". Only ten commandos were able to return to Pakistan, the rest were taken as prisoners of war (including one of the Commanders of the operations, Major Khalid Butt). At Adampur these troops landed in residential areas where the villagers caught and handed them over to police.<br>
								The Indo-Pakistani war of 1971 on western front started with Operation Chengiz Khan on 3 December 1971. Pathankot Air Force Station was hit and runway heavily damaged. Pathankot was covered by interceptors from Adampur following this first strike during the time it took the ground crew to repair its runway.<br>
								During 1999 Kargil Conflict flying from Adampur AFB, Mirages of No. 7 Squadron IAF struck Tigerhill, Muntho Dhalo and Tololing.
