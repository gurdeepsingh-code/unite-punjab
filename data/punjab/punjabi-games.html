						Introduction &#x21e3
					</div>
					<p id="tab2a_data">
						Stapoo (also known as Chindro/ Hopscotch/ Picho or Kidi-Kada) is a popular rural game of Indian Sub-Continent. It is a popular outdoor game played widely by girls across regions. It is commonly played by girls in the age group of 6 to 12. The game can be played by any number of players taking turns in a pre-defined sequence. Commonly 3 - 5 players are involved. If the number of people is large, more grids are drawn. Primarily it is a favourite pastime of small and teenage girls, but young boys too can take part in it.<br>
					</p>
					<div id="tab2b" class="sub_sub_heading">
						Equipment required &#x21e3
					</div>
					<p id="tab2b_data">
						The game costs nothing and requires only two small things: a small piece of Chalk or Coal is needed to draw a “Playing Court” and a square or round piece of a flat stone (usually not bigger than 4 inches in diameter) is used as the playing object. As a matter of fact, most of the time an empty small tin box of a shoe polish is filled with sand and is used as the playing object.
					</p>
					<div id="tab2c" class="sub_sub_heading">
						How to Play &#x21e3
					</div>
					<div id="tab2c_data">
					<p>
						One of the participants draws a “Playing Court” on a flat surface (usually the floor of alleys) with the help of a piece of coal or chalk. The size of the “Playing Court” depends upon the wishes of the participants and may thus vary greatly. For example if all the participants agree to have a “Playing Court” of Eight Boxes (2 feet by 4 feet each) then that constitutes the “Playing Court”. Therefore, there are no set parameters for drawing the “Playing Court”.<br>
						The player starts the game by throwing a stone inside the first square. The stone must land within the confines of the square. The player hops through the court, landing on one foot in single squares and both feet in double squares. At the end of the course, the player turns around and moves back to the beginning, stopping to pick up the stone on the way back. If the player successfully finishes the course, he or she throws the stone into the second square and repeats the exercise. The player loses a chance to play every time he or she is unable to throw the stone within the designated area of the square, or if they lose balance. She/he will start in their turn from where they had stopped in his last turn. The first player to move the stone through the entire grid wins the game. <br>
						Consequently the player’s turn prematurely ends when:<br>
						<ul><p>
							<li>The player can no longer stand on one foot and both feet touch the “Playing Court” area, or</li>
							<li>The stone stops on one of the lines, or</li>
							<li>Slides out of the “Playing Court” before it could reach the last box.</li></p>
						</ul>
					</p>
					</div>
					<div id="tab2d" class="sub_sub_heading">
						Variation &#x21e3
					</div>
					<p id="tab2d_data">
						This game is played in different regions with variations in the rules as well as the grid that is drawn.<br>
						In some regions, the game is extended by the players by trying to capture the squares to build 'houses' on the squares. After completing the entire course of the grid, the player stands with their back towards the rectangle and they throw the stone over their head. The square where the stone rests is declared to be their 'house.' They write their names which mean they own that number and they can hop in those boxes with both their feet. Whereas, the others have to skip that box and make long jumps to hop to the next one. Now, for this player the game is played from the other end so the player starts from number 8 till the number 1. The player, who captures maximum number of houses, wins.

								It is more of a sport than a dance for young girls. Two girls stands face to face close to each other and hold their hands crossing arms with their bodies inclined back; in this position their arms are stretched to the maximum and hands interlock firmly. Then they wheel round fast continuously with their dupattas floating in the air and anklets making tinkling sound.The other ladies encourages them to go faster and faster by singing songs with clapping. Sometimes it is done by four girls. The folk song related to the dance has much variety.

						How to Play &#x21e3
					</div>
					<p id="tab5c_data">
						The players are divided in two teams to play this game – the hitter team and the opponent team. "Gilli Danda" is played with two pieces of equipment – a danda, being a long wooden stick, and a gilli, a small oval-shaped piece of wood.<br>
						Standing in a small circle, the player balances the gilli on a stone in an inclined manner (somewhat like a see-saw) with one end of the gilli touching the ground while the other end is in the air. The player then uses the danda to hit the gilli at the raised end, which flips it into the air. While it is in the air, the player strikes the gilli, hitting it as far as possible. Having struck the gilli, the player is required to run and touch a pre-agreed point outside the circle before the gilli is retrieved by an opponent. There are no specific dimensions of gilli danda and it does not have limited number of players.<br>
						The gilli becomes airborne after it is struck. If a fielder from the opposing team catches the gilli, the striker is out. If the gilli lands on the ground, the fielder closest to the gilli has one chance to hit the danda (which has to be placed on top of the circle used) with a throw (similar to a run out in cricket). If the fielder is successful, the striker is out; if not, the striker scores one point and gets another opportunity to strike. The team (or individual) with the most points wins the game. If the striker fails to hit the gilli in three tries, the striker is out (similar to a strikeout in baseball). After the gilli has been struck, the opposing players need to return to the circle or, in the best case, catch it in mid-air without its hitting the ground – this was believed to have later evolved into a Catch Out in cricket and baseball.

						Variation &#x21e3
					</div>
					<p id="tab5d_data">
					As an amateur youth sport, gilli-danda has many regional variations. In some versions, the number of points a striker scores depends on the distance the gilli falls from the striking point. The distance is measured in terms of the length of the danda, or in some cases the length of the gilli. Scoring also depends on how many times the gilli was hit in the air in one strike. If it travels a certain distance with two mid-air strikes, the total points are doubled.If the gilli is not struck far enough the player has to pick it up and try again.

					<p id="tab5e_data">
						In 2014 Vitti Dandu a sport-drama Marathi movie was made on the same sport produced by Ajay Devgan and Leena Deore.<br>
						The Bollywood movie Lagaan mentions the traditional youth sport of gilli-danda as being similar to cricket.<br>
						The Hindi writer Premchand wrote a short story named "Gilli-danda" in which he compares old simple times and emotions to modern values and also hints at caste inequalities in India. The protagonist and narrator of the story recounts his inability to play gilli-danda well in his youth. He remembers a friend who could literally control the gilli as he wished. He goes away and comes back as an adult and a government officer. He searches for his old friend and finds him – he is very poor and says "Where do we get the time?" when asked by the protagonist whether he plays gilli-danda. The protagonist convinces him to play – he cheats at every opportunity, but his friend meekly submits, even though he would not have let him get away with such deceit in his youth. After being defeated, the friend invites him to a gilli-danda match the next day. The protagonist is shocked when he sees his friend play just as well as before and realises that he had indulged him because he knew that he had forgotten the basics of gilli-danda. The protagonist feels very small and goes back to the city humiliated.

						All the players sit in a close circle with their hands on the floor facing down and fingers spread apart. One player becomes the leader and participates by keeping only one hand as against all other players who place both their hands on the ground. Only the leader recites the song of Akkad Bakkad touching fingers of every player one by one. This continues in a clockwise manner touching one finger at a time. The player on whose finger the song ends (with the word bhaaga or be-sha-ram if playing with the extension version) closes his finger and the game continues by repeating the same recitation from the finger immediately next to the one closed.  Each finger closed is skipped and not counted while reciting the song. One by one all fingers close and players with all five fingers closed can take their hands away. The player first with all ten fingers closed wins the game. The game continues until all the players get to close each of their fingers.

						Each team consists of twelve players, but only nine players take the field for a contest. A match consists of two innings. An innings consists of chasing and running turns of 7 minutes each. Eight members of the chasing team sit in their eight squares on the central lane, alternately facing the opposite direction, while the ninth member is an active chaser, and stands at either of the posts, ready to begin the pursuit. Members of the chasing team have to put their opponent out, touching them with their palms, but without committing a foul. All the action in Kho-Kho is provided by the defenders, who try to play out the 7 minutes time, and the chasers who try to dismiss them. A defender can be dismissed in three ways: 1) if he is touched by an active chaser with his palm without committing a foul, 2) if he goes out of the limits on his own, 3) if he enters the limit late.<br>
						Defenders enter the limit, in batches of three. After the third and last defender of batch is out, the next batch must enter the limits, before a 'Kho' is given by the successful active chaser. Defenders have full freedom of movement on both sides of the central lane, but the active chaser cannot change the direction to which he is committed. He cannot cross the central lane. An active chaser can change position with a seated chaser, by touching him from behind by palm, and uttering the word 'Kho' loudly, and simultaneously, chase or attack is build up through a series of 'Kho' as the chase continues with a relay of chasers.<br>
						At the end of the innings there is an interval of 5 minutes and an interval of 2 minutes, in between the turns. Each side alternates between chasing and defence.<br>

						A folk game which many of us have grown up playing is Pithoo or Pithoo garam .  Pittu Garam (Seven Stones) ( Punjabi:ਪਿੱਠੂ ਗਰਮ, Urdu:پٹھو گرم, Sindhi: پِٺُو گرم‎) is a traditional South Asian game played between two teams. The game is called Lagori in kannada. The game requires a tennis ball and set of seven stones which can be stacked up to form a small tower. The aim of the game is to be able to break the tower and then rebuild it before getting hit by one of the opponent. The game of Pithoo can be played amongst 10 people or even more. Two teams compete against each other much like many other games .The number of players in each time can be any where from two and more depending upon the number of kids show up to the village ground. Pithoo one of the games which is still a big craze in villages of Punjab . There is no special equipment required for this game except a soft rubber ball and few flat disc stones.One of the team is given a chance to be a striker and the other is called fielder team. The captain members of both the teams stand facing each other at a distance of 10 to 15 feet, and the ball being placed between them, respective team members make queue and line up behind their respective team captain. Pithoo is ready to start now.The captain of the striker team tries to hit the stone tower with the ball with a direct hit, If the ball does not hits the stones and is caught by any of the opposite team member after a single bounce, the captain is marked out of the game and have to sit outside the field and wait till his team has finished their turn. This way each member tries of the striker team and if is marked out have to sit outside the field, till all members are out, then the opposite team gets to be the striker team. The interesting part, which is the main fun, happens when the ball hits the stone tower. The stones scatter on the ground and everybody can be seen running around the field. At this time the striker team members try to fix the stone tower back without getting hit by the ball. The job of the fielder team is to hit the ball to as many members of the striker team before the striker team members can buildup the stone tower back up. You could easily see a lot of co-ordination and teamwork being exercised during this chaos by both teams as both the teams strives hard. This chaos ends if members of striker team are unable to build the stone tower back up and get hit by the ball or they successfully build the tower. If the tower is built back, the striker team can accumulate points or can also call any one member of their team from outside of the field is any one was sent out. Once all the members of the striker team are out, then the opposite team gets a chance to be the striker and the game starts again.
