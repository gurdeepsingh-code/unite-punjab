						The Beas River is a river passing through the northern Indian states of Himachal Pradesh and PunjabThe Punjab state has received its name from the five rivers that flows in the state and among these rivers one river is Beas. The river initiates from the Rohtang Pass that is a part of the Himalayan range located in the state of Himachal Pradesh. It flows through 13,050 feet of height and is as long as 290 miles or 470 kms. Later, this river merges with the River Sutlej that is in Harike Pattan located in the southern part of city of Amritsar in the state of Punjab. The River finally merges into Arabian Sea.<br><br>
						The Beas town in the Amritsar district of Punjab lying at its banks is named after the river. The river serves as a source of water to all the cities, towns and villages that fall in its course.

									During the ancient times in India, the Greeks named this River as Arjiki or Vipas. The existing name of the River Beas has been modified from its older name Vyas. The name Vyas was given after Veda Vyas who belonged to the era of Mahabharata. The book name of this River is Vipasha that is common in the region of Himachal Pradesh.<br><br>
									The first name given to this river was a Sanskrit name called “Vipasha” that was later modified and named as Beas. The meaning of the name is from the word “Vi-Pasha” that stands for the one who eliminates the oppression. The story that is linked with the name of this river is based on the event that happened in the life of Saint Vasistha. Saint Vasistha was hurt after the death of his 100th son and so he strived to take off his life by trying to drown himself in the river tying to a twine. While he was trying to take his life the river got softened to him and freed him from the tether of the rope and threw him on the banks of the river.<br><br>
									In the 20th century, the river was developed under the Beas Project for irrigation and hydroelectric power generation purposes.

					The Sutlej River (alternatively spelled as Satluj River) (Hindi: सतलुज, Punjabi: ਸਤਲੁਜ, Sanskrit : शतद्रु (shatadru) Urdu: درياۓ ستلُج‎ ) is the longest of the five rivers that flow through the historic crossroads region of Punjab in northern India and Pakistan. The Sutlej River is also known as Satadree.<br><br>
					The Satluj-This is the principal river of Kinnaur almost dividing the district into two parts. It runs within the Himalayan mountains for about 450 kilometers and the first part of its course is west-north-west. When it enters Kinnaur, it generally takes south-westerly direction. Within the District the length is about 130 km. Its source is supposed to be at a great elevation on the southern face of the Kailash range whence it flows into the sacred lake Rawan Hard. As far as the village of Khab it is almost a razing torrent. At Khab it receives the Spiti river where the bed of stream is still above 2,589 m high from the mean sea level. The Satluj descends from about 3,050 m (the point of its entrance in the district), to 1,220 m at Chaura flowing almost the whole way between narrow cliffs and therefore, there is no open ground worth describing all along its bank.The water of the river is more or less discoloured.Cultivated fields in terraces are generally at considerable height from its banks and thus immune from the turbidity of water which largest in June, July and August. The average discharge is about 2,000 cusecs during the winter and 100,000 cusec during June-July. The tributaries of the Satluj in this district are the Spiti, the Ropa, the Taiti, the Kashang, the Mulgoon, the Yula, the Wanger, the Shorang and the Rupi on the right bank and the Tirung, the Gyanthing, the Baspa, the Duling and the Solding running on the left bank.<br><br>
					The Sutlej river rises near Rakastal which is fed by the lake Mansrover in the Tibetan Plateau at an elevation level (EL) of about 4,572 M. The river Sutlej is known as Langqen Zagbo inside Tibet/China. The River Sutlej travels about 322 Kms inside the Tibetan Province and then enters India near Shipkilla (Tashigang-village) and further Sutlej River travels about 300 Kms upto Bhakra Dam. This large river has varying climatic and topographic conditions. The total catchment area is about 56,860 Sq. Kms; out of which only about 20,000 sq. kms lie in India . In the Indian region an area of about 9,000 sq. kms. gets only snowfall, an area of about 5,500 Sq. Kms gets both snow and rain and an area of about 5,500 sq. kms only rainfall.<br><br>
					The waters of the Sutlej are allocated to India under the Indus Waters Treaty between India and Pakistan, and are mostly diverted to irrigation canals in India.There are several major hydroelectric projects on the Sutlej, including the 1,000 MW Bhakra Dam, the 1,000 MW Karcham Wangtoo Hydroelectric Plant, and the 1,530 MW Nathpa Jhakri Dam.

								<ul>
									<li>The Upper Sutlej Valley, called Langqên Zangbo in Tibet, was once known as the Garuda Valley by the Zhangzhung, the ancient civilization of western Tibet. The Garuda Valley was the centre of their empire, which stretched many miles into the nearby Himalayas. The Zhangzhung built a towering palace in the Upper Sutlej Valley called Kyunglung, the ruins of which still exist today near the village of Moincêr, southwest of Mount Kailash (Mount Ti-se). Eventually, the Zhangzhung were conquered by the Tibetan Empire.</li>
									<li>The boundaries of Greater Nepal extended westward to beyond Satluj River until the tide turned in 1809 and Kangra king repulsed Gorkha army eastward with help from Maharaja Ranjit Singh.</li>
									<li>Today, the Sutlej Valley is inhabited by nomadic descendants of the Zhangzhung, who live in tiny villages of yak herders.</li>
									<li>The Sutlej was the main medium of transportation for the kings of that time. In the early 18th century, it was used to transport devdar woods for Bilaspur district, Hamirpur district, and other places along the Sutlej's banks.</li>
									<li>Of four rivers (Indus, Sutlej, Brahmaputra and Karnali/Ganges) mythically flowing out of holy Lake Manasarovar, the Sutlej is actually connected by channels that are dry most of the time.</li>

									<li>The source of the Sutlej is west of Lake Rakshastal in Tibet, as springs in an ephemeral stream channel descending from this lake. Rakshastal in turn is ephemerally connected by Ganga Chhu to sacred Lake Manasarovar about 4 KM further east. The nascent river flows at first west-northwest for about 260 kilometres (160 mi) under the Tibetan name Langqên Zangbo (Elephant River or Elephant Spring) to the Shipki La pass, entering India in Himachal Pradesh state. It then turns slightly, heading west-southwest for about 360 kilometres (220 mi) to meet the Beas River near Makhu, Firozpur district, Punjab state. North western part of Panchkula district in Haryana state is located in the Sutlej river basin.Thus Haryana is also a riparian state of Indus river basin.</li>
									<li>Continuing west-southwest, the Sutlej enters Pakistan about 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) east of Bhedian Kalan, Kasur District, Punjab province, continuing southwest to water the ancient and historical former Bahawalpur princely state.</li>
									<li>About 17 kilometres (11 mi) north of Uch Sharif, the Sutlej unites with the Chenab River, forming the Panjnad River, which finally flows into the Indus river about 100 kilometres (62 mi) west of the city of Bahawalpur. The area to the southeast on the Pakistani side of the Indian border is called the Cholistan Desert and, on the Indian side, the Thar Desert.</li>
									<li>The Indus then flows through a gorge near Sukkur and the fertile plains region of Sindh, forming a large delta region between the border of Gujarat, India and Pakistan, finally terminating in the Arabian Sea near the port city of Karachi, Pakistan. During floods, Indus river water flows in to Indian part of Great Rann of Kutch. Thus Gujarat state of India is also a riparian state of Indus river as Rann of Kutch area lying west of Kori Creek in the state is part of the Indus River Delta.</li>

							<p>
								The Sutlej, along with all of the Punjab rivers, is thought to have drained east into the Ganges prior to 5 mya.<br><br>
								There is substantial geologic evidence to indicate that prior to 1700 BC, and perhaps much earlier, the Sutlej was an important tributary of the Ghaggar-Hakra River (thought to be the legendary Sarasvati River) rather than the Indus, with various authors putting the redirection from 2500 to 2000 BC, from 5000 to 3000 BC, or before 8000 BC. Geologists believe that tectonic activity created elevation changes which redirected the flow of Sutlej from the southeast to the southwest. If the diversion of the river occurred recently (about 4000 years ago), it may have been responsible for the Ghaggar-Hakra (Saraswati) drying up, causing desertification of Cholistan and the eastern part of the modern state of Sindh, and the abandonment of Harappan settlements along the Ghaggar. However, the Sutlej may have already been captured by the Indus thousands of years earlier.<br><br>
								There is some evidence that the high rate of erosion caused by the modern Sutlej River has influenced the local faulting and rapidly exhumed rocks above Rampur. This would be similar to, but on a much smaller scale than, the exhumation of rocks by the Indus River in Nanga Parbat, Pakistan. The Sutlej River also exposes a doubled inverted metamorphic gradient.

							<p>
								There has been a proposal to build a 214-kilometre (133 mi) long heavy freight and irrigation canal, to be known as the Sutlej-Yamuna Link (SYL) to connect the Sutlej and Yamuna rivers.The project is intended to connect the Ganges, which flows to the east coast of the subcontinent, with points west, via Pakistan. When completed, the SYL would enable inland shipping from India's east coast to its west coast (on the Arabian sea) without having to round the southern tip of India by sea, vastly shortening shipping distances, alleviating pressures on seaports, avoiding sea hazards, creating business opportunities along the route, raising real estate values, raising tax revenue, and establishing important commercial links and providing jobs for north-central India's large population. However, the proposal has met with obstacles and has been referred to the Supreme Court of India.

					<b>Ravi</b> River is in northwestern of India and northeastern of Pakistan. It is one of the five tributaries of the Indus River that give the <b>Punjab</b> (meaning <i>“Five Rivers”</i>) its name.<br><br>
					It rises in the Himalayas in Himachal Pradesh state, India, and flows west-northwest past Chamba, turning southwest at the boundary of Jammu and Kashmir state. The river then flows into Pakistan and after running a course of 50 miles (approx 80 km) enters the Punjab province past Lahore and turning west at <i>Kamalia</i>. Finally, Ravi River empties itself into <b>Chenab</b> River at the southern part of <i>Ahmedpur Sial</i> with a total course of 450 miles (725 km).<br><br>
					After the partition of India in 1947, the rivers of Ravi along with others in the Indus system was divided between the countries as per the <i>Indus Water Treaty</i>. The Indus Basin Project was subsequently taken up by Pakistan while many inter basis transfers like irrigation, hydropower and several multipurpose projects were built in the Indian Territory.

					History of Ravi River	<span class="caret"></span>
				</div>
					<div id="ravi_tab1_data">
						<p>
							As per Indian Vedas, <b>Ravi</b> was traditionally known as <b>Iravati</b> also spelt and pronounced <i>Airavati</i>. To the ancient Greeks, Ravi River was referred to as the <i>Hydraotes</i>. The part of the legendary battle of the ten kings was fought on the banks of the <b>Parushani</b> River, later inferred by <i>MacDonell</i> and <i>Keith</i> as the Ravi River. The Nikruta 9.26 also draws reference of the Ravi River in Punjab. When the <i>Indian National Congress</i> changed it goals to <b>Purna Swaraj</b> or Total Independence, President <i>Jawaharlal Nehru</i> unfurled the tricolor on the banks of Ravi River in the midnight hours of 31st December 1929 amidst the slogans of <i>‘Inquilab Zindabad’</i> and <i>‘Bande Mataram’</i>.<br><br>
							When the river first cross the <b>Himalayan Mountain ranges</b>, it drains into the first known civilization at ancient <i>Chamba</i>, today known as the <i>Bharmour</i>. <i>Bharmour</i> used to be the capital of the <i>Chamba</i> civilization in ancient times and this is marked by the presence of a famous temple called the <b>Chaurasia Temple</b>. About 10 kilometers from the Chaurasia Temple is the Dal Lake. Flowing ahead another 50 kilometers, Ravi divides the Chamba plains into two parts (now connected by a bridge). This is also the location for the <b>NHPC</b> (National Hydroelectric Power Corporation) project. Finally across Pakistan and the Punjab province, the River drains into <i>Chenab</i> and finally into the Arabian Sea.<br><br>
							As per satellite studies carried over an extensive period of 20 years, the Ravi River had meandered across a substantial alluvial plain in <i>Gurdaspur</i> and <i>Amritsar</i> districts in Punjab. This did result in extensive damage in the Indian Territory as a result of the changing course northwards. The reasons for the change of course can be must designated to man-made obstructions constructed in Pakistan. The total change in course is reported to be around 4.8 kilometers.

							Ravi River basically emerges in the Himalayan Ranges from a place locally known as the Bada Banghal. This origin is situated on the borders of Chamba near the Spiti and Lahual valley, but generally draining the Chamba Valley. The Bada Banghal is located at an elevation of 4300 meters above the sea level. In ancient times, Ravi was known to be the Iravati River and is now one of the few trans-border Asian draining both India and Pakistan. The source of Ravi River is basically glacial melt and it is covered with snow throughout the year. The total course of the Ravi River is 850 kilometers before it melts into Chenab to meet the Sea. The river combines with Chenab in Lahore in the Punjab Province of Pakistan.<br><br>
							The Ravi is the smallest of all the five Punjab Rivers rising from the glacial elevation of over 14,000 feet. As it starts out, it forms a gorge having a river bed of 1:185 ft per mile and fed by glaciers. The Ravi origin also falls in the rain shadow region for the Southern monsoons. Flowing southwest and crossing Dalhousie, it cuts another gorge across the Dhauladhar Ranges before entering Punjab near Pathankot and Madhopur.

					Chenab
				</div>
				<p>
				The Chenab River (Punjabi: ਚਨਾਬ, Hindi: चनाब, literally: 'Moon(Chen) River(ab)') is formed by the confluence of the Chandra and Bhaga rivers at Tandi located in the upper Himalayas, in the Lahul and Spiti District of Himachal Pradesh, India. In its upper reaches it is also known as the Chandrabhaga. It flows through the Jammu region of Jammu and Kashmir into the plains of the Punjab, forming the boundary between the Rechna and Jech interfluves (Doabs in Persian). It is joined by the Jhelum River at Trimmu, and then by the Ravi River. It then merges with the Sutlej River near Uch Sharif to form the Panjnad ('Five Rivers'), which joins the Indus at Mithankot. The total length of the Chenab is approximately 960 kilometres. The waters of the Chenab are allocated to Pakistan under the terms of the Indus Waters Treaty.<br><br>
				The Chenab originates from the Bara Lacha Pass in Himachal Pradesh,has been considered as the source of the glacier fed perennial river.The anicient knew the river ar ASIKNI,it has two sources one which flows down south known as Chandra and that goes to North named as Bhaga. About 26 Km further south from Manali (a tourist place in Himachal Pradesh) ,a motorable road runs along the river,from Khoskhas to Tandi. In all 107 Km length of road run side by side of river during the sarjoun of Himachal Pardesh.The Chandra and Bhaga meets to form Chandrbhaga at Tandi. It becomes Chenab when it joins Marau at Bhandera Kot 12 Km from Kishtwar Town in J&K.<br><br>
				The river then travels to Reasi,where it has been dammed at Salal at Hydroelectric Project. There is a motorable road runs along the river in the stretch between Atholi, Malhori, Perah and Ramban, Kautham and Jourian in J&K. The road is often 50 to 100 meters above the river Chenab with wonderful view of various facets of the river.<br><br>
				The river was known to Indians in Vedic period as Ashkini (Sanskrit: अशढ़किनि) or Iskmati and as Acesines to the Ancient Greeks. In 325 BC, Alexander the Great allegedly founded the town of Alexandria on Indus (present day Uch Sharif or Mithankot or Chacharan) at the confluence of the Indus and the combined stream of Punjab rivers (currently known as the Panjnad River).<br><br>
				The Chenab has the same place in the consciousness of the people of the Punjab, as, say the Rhine holds for the Germans, or the Danube for the Austrians and the Hungarians. It is the iconic river around which Punjabi consciousness revolves, and plays a prominent part in the tale of Heer Ranjha, the Punjabi national epic.
