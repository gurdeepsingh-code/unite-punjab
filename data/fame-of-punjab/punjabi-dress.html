	<h1 class="center">ਪੰਜਾਬੀ ਪਹਿਰਾਵਾ (Punjabi Dresses)</h1>
		<p>
		In the ancient Punjab region, people wore cotton clothing. The tops for both sexes reached to the knees. A scarf was worn over the tops which would be draped over theleft shoulder and under the right. A large sheet would befurther draped over one shoulder which would hang loose towards the knees. Both sexes wore a dhoti around the waist. Modern Punjabi dress has retained this outfit but over its long history has added other forms of dress.<br> 
		The Punjab region had a flourishing industry in cotton during the 19th and early 20th centuries, when various kinds of coarse cotton cloths including lungi, khes, datahi, chadders, coasting, shirting, curtains, susi, tehmats, durris, towels, dusters, patkas etc. were manufactured in Hoshiarpur, Gurdaspur, Peshawar, Lahore, Multan, Amritsar, Ludhiana, Jhang, Shahpur, Jalandhar, Delhi, Gurgaon, Rohtak, Karnal, Rewari, Panipat etc. This cotton industry added to the richness of Punjabi clothing which exhibits Punjab’s rich and vibrant culture in its dresses. Various types of dresses are worn based on different Punjabi festivals, local events and ceremonies. Along with different traditional dresses special types of ornaments are also very common.

		<h2 class="center">Men's Wear</h2>
		<div class="sub_heading">Suthan</div>
			<p>
				The use of the suthan in the Punjab region also called suthana in Punjabi is a survival of the ancient svasthana. Svasthana referred to a lower garment which can be described as a type of trousers. The svasthana was in use amongst the rulers in the Mauryan times(322–185 BCE), amongst the ruling classes in North India during the Kushan Empire between the 1st and 3rd centuries C.E, during the Gupta Empire between 4th and 6th centuries C.E. and during King Harsha’s rule during the 7th century C.E.<br>
				The Punjabi suthan is a direct variation of the svasthana which can either be loose to above the ankles and tight around the ankles, or loose to the knees and tight to the ankles. The suthan is a male and female garment but its use is particularly important in the Punjabi suthan suit whereby it is worn by women with a kurti or kurta. It is also a part of the Punjabi ghagra outfit. Other variations include the choga (robe) and suthan combination.
			</p>
					
		<div class="sub_heading">Kurta</div>
			<p>
				The kurta with its side slits in the Punjabi kurta can be traced to the 11th century C.E. female kurtaka worn in parts of north India. The kurtaka was a short shirt, with sleeves extending from the shoulders, to the middle of the body, and had slashes on the left and the right sides. This is the same as the modern Punjabi kurta which has side slits and is worn by women in the Punjab region as do men. The kurta also draws inspiration from the jama and the Punjabi angarkha. The kurta can be worn with a salwar, suthan, tehmat, lungi, dhoti, Punjabi ghagra and jeans.<br>
				<b>Multani Kurta : </b>The Multani kurta is crocheted using designs of Multan (Punjab, Pakistan). Local Ajrak prints are also used.<br>
				<b>punjabi Phulkari Kurta : </b>A Phulkari kurta is emroidered using the Phulkari embroidery of the Punjab region.<br>
				<b>Punjabi Bandhani Kurta : </b>Bandhani tye-dyeing is popular in the Cholistan desert area of the Punjab region. Bandhani patterns are used on kurtas.<br>
				<b>Muktsari Kurta : </b>The traditional Punjabi kurta of the Punjab region is wide and falls to the knees and is cut straight. The modern version of the regional kurta is the Mukatsari kurta which originates from Muktsar in Punjab. This modern Punjabi kurta is famous for its slim fitting cuts and smart fit designs. It is very popular among young politicians.
			</p>
			
		<h2 class="center">Women's Wear</h2>
		<div class="sub_heading">Salwar Suit</div>
			<p>
				The Punjabi suit is the traditional dress of women in the Punjab region. It is made up of a kurta or kameez and a straight cut salwar. In some parts of the Punjab region, men also wear the Punjabi suit.<br>
				The Punjabi suit is cut differently to the styles worn in Balochistan and Afghanistan and is known as a “Punjabi suit” with the kameez being cut straight and flat with side slits (which is a local development as earlier forms of kameez did not have side slits). The salwar is wide at the top but fits closely to the legs and is gathered at the ankles. The Punjabi salwar is also cut straight and gathered at the ankles with a loose band reinforced with coarse material. In rural Punjab, the salwar is still called the suthan. The Punjabi suit is popular in other regions of the subcontinent, such as Mumbai and Sindh. It is also popular in Afghanistan, where it is called the Punjabi.
					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Punjabi Tamba And Kurta
					</div>
					<p>
						The Punjabi version of the dhoti is known as
Tehmat/Tamba or laccha. Whereas the tehmat is
of one colour and has no border, the laacha has a border
and is variegated so that it has more than one colour.
					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Kurti
					</div>
					<p>
						In modern usage, a short kurta is referred to as the kurti.
However, traditionally, the kurti refers to upper garments
which sit above the waist without side slits, and are believed
to have descended from the tunic of the Shunga
period (2nd century B.C.).<br>
In the Punjab region, the kurti is a short cotton coat.
Another style of Punjabi kurti is a short version of the
anga (robe). The kurti can be worn by men but women
wear it along with the Punjabi ghagra or suthan.

					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Pothohari suit
					</div>
					<p>
						Another style of the Punjabi suit is the use of the salwar
which hails from the Pothohar region of Punjab, Pakistan
and is known as the Pothohari salwar. The Pothohari
salwar retains the wideness of the older Punjabi suthan
and also has some folds. The kameez is also wide. The
head scarf is traditionally large, similar to the chador
or Phulkari that was used throughout the plains of the
Punjab region
					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Chola
					</div>
					<p>
						The chola is a long outfit which is similar to a gown. It is
worn by women and men and can reach the ankles, or
fall just below the knees. The traditional chola is closed
by loops and is tied on either shoulder and tends not to
have side slits. The chola is the traditional alternative to
other upper garments of the local region. The modern
chola opens at the front below the neck, is closed with buttons
and may have side slits, and is worn like a kurta.
In Himachal Pradesh, the woolen waist band is called a
dora.

					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Choga
					</div>
					<p>
						A choga is a long sleeved, skirted cloak that opens to the
down front and is fastened above the waist.
					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Punjabi Suthan Suit
					</div>
					<p>
						The Punjabi suthan and kurta/kurti suit is an outfit
with a very long history. The Punjabi suthan is a local
variation of the ancient svasthana tight fitting trousers
which have been used in the Punjab region since the ancient
period and was worn with the tunic called
varbana which was tight fitting.<br>
The Punjabi suthan is arranged in plaits and uses large
amounts of material (traditionally coloured cotton with
vertical silk lines, called sussi) of up to 20 yards hanging
in innumerable folds. The suthan ends at the ankles
with a tight band which distinguishes the suthan
from a salwar. Some versions of the Punjabi suthan
tighten from the knees down to the ankles (a remnant of
the svasthana). If a tight band is not used, the ends of the
suthan fit closely around the ankles. The head scarf can
be a wide chador, phulkari or modern dupatta/chunni.

					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Punjabi Ghagra
					</div>
					<p>
						The Punjabi ghagra was the traditional apparel for women
before the advent of the Punjabi suit.It is still worn in parts
of the Punjab region and the outfit comprises the head
scarf, kurta/kurti, suthan/salwar and the ghagra. <br>
The ghagra has its origin in the candataka, which had become
a popular garment in the Gupta period. The candataka
was a men’s half trousers which eventually developed
into the ghagra. The intermediate formation has
been described as a shirt like dress for men and women
from the neck to the thighs. Candataka continued
as a popular female dress in the seventh century.
					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Punjabi Juti
					</div>
					<p>
						The PunjabiJutti is the Punjabi version of the shoe. Local
styles include designs from Patiala, the Pothohari shoe
with sharp pointed toes, and the Derawali shoe with silk
embroidery and round tipped.
					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Patiala Salwar
					</div>
					<p>
						The Patiala salwar was developed in Patiala and is very
popular with women.

					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Saraiki Shalwar Suits
					</div>
					<p>
						Saraiki shalwar suits are Punjabi outfits which include the
Bahawalpuri shalwar suit and the Multani shalwar suit.
					</p>
					<div class="sub_heading">
						Bahawalpuri Shalwar Suit
					</div>
					<p>
						The Bahawalpuri shalwar originates from the
Bahawalpur region of Punjab, Pakistan. The Bahawalpuri
shalwar is very wide and baggy with many
voluminous folds. The material traditionally used
for the Bahawalpuri shalwar and suthan is known as
Sufi which is a mixture of cotton warp mixed with silk
weft and gold threads running down the material.
The other name for these types of mixed cloth is shuja
khani. The Bahawalpuri shalwar is worn with the
Bahawalpur style kameez, the Punjabi kurta or chola.
					</p>
					<div class="sub_heading">
						Multani Shalwar Suit
					</div>
					<p>
						The Multani shalwar, also known as the 'ghaire wali' or
'Saraiki ghaire wali' shalwar as it is very wide around
the waist, originates from the Multan area of the Punjab
region. The style is similar to the Sindhi kancha shalwar
as both are derivatives of the pantaloon shalwar worn
in Iraq and adopted in these locations during the 7th
century A.D. The Multani shalwar is very wide,
baggy, full and has folds like the Punjabi suthan.
The upper garments include the Punjabi kameez and the
chola of the Punjab region.
					</p>
					<div class="heading">
						Fabric Prints and embroidery
					</div>
					<p>
						Block printing on cotton and other materials is popular
in Multan which utilises local Ajrak prints. The
other type of prints are known as chit Multani or
Multani chint. Cholistan, Bahawalpur and Multan are
known for its tie-dying material which is popular in this
region.<br>
The emroidery styles of the Punjab region include the
styles of Multani embroidery which features kalabatun
patterns using thin wires. This type of embroidery is also
common in the rest of the Punjab region. Kalabatan surkh
involves using gold wires on orange coloured and red silk.
Kalabatan safed involves using silver wires on white material.
There are two kinds of gold embroidery, one of a
solid and rich kind called kar-chob and the other called
tila-kar or kar-chikan utilising gold thread. The former
is used for carpets and saddle cloths whereas the latter is
used for dresses. The Punjab region also uses mukesh embroidery:
mukesh bati-hui, twisted tinsel, mukesh gokru,
flattened gold wire for embroidery of a heavy kind, and
waved mukesh, made by crimping mukesh batihui with
iron tongs.<br>
Ludhiana and Amritsar are known for embroidery using
white, silver and gold threads on clothes such as chogas
and waistcoats (phatuhi). Kangra is known for the patterns

						Churidar Pajama
					</div>

						The use of the churidar is traditionally associated with

is no consensus as to its origins, the churidar pajamma
was adopted by the former princely families. In the
Punjab region however, its use was amongst the general
population.<br>
For people of the Punjab region, the churidar pajamma
which forms part of the traditional attire of men and
women in Punjab is a combination of the tight suthan
of the Punjab region, the churidar suthan of the Punjab’s
hill area, and the traditional Dogri suthan which ends in
loose bangles (and is more of a loose pajamma as the
suthan has to have a tight band at the ankles). Accordingly,
the churidar pajamma is believed to be derived
from the suthan. The Churidar is popular all over the subcontinent
and was developed in the Punjab region, and is
associated with the Punjab. The churidar pajama
can be of any colour but traditionally is of sussi (cotton)
material, in blue with vertical stripes.
The churidar pajama is also known as the (full length)
ghuttana. When soldiers from Lucknow travelled to
the British Punjab province, they saw the long ghuttana
pajama and adopted its use in Lucknow during the 19th
century.
