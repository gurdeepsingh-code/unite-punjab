			<p>
			The couple commit to enter into wedlock and to refuse other proposals of marriage. Ardaas is said and gifts are exchanged.<br>
			</p>
			
			<div id="rokka" class="sub_heading">Rokka (Pre-Wedding)</div>
			<p>It is an unofficial engagement ceremony where the groom's family and friends come give presents, money and blessings to the bride to be. The origin of this ceremony lies in the arranged marriage norm where the parents would let out the world that they are looking for a suitable match for their son or daughter. And once they had found that match, their search had come to an end. Though rings are not exchanged, the couple stand unofficially engaged after this ceremony. Looking forward to starting the wedding ceremonies. Traditionally when individuals weren't allowed to see their mate, Rokka was like an engagement.<br>
			</p>
			
			<div id="mangni" class="sub_heading">Mangni/Shagun (engagement)</div>
			<p>Engagement is a significant part of a Punjabi wedding. The bride's family visits the groom's family with gifts to confirm the engagement.</p><br>
			
			<div id="sagai" class="sub_heading">Sagai</div>
			<p>Approximately a week before the wedding the sagai ceremony is held, in which a tikka forehead mark is applied. The bride's family visits the groom's family bringing gifts, the paste for the tikka mark and a silver tray with a few grains of rice and saffron in a small silver bowl, 14 dried dates (chuharey) wrapped in silver foil and a coconut wrapped in gold leaf. The bride's father applies the mark to the groom's forehead, blesses him and gives him some money. The bride's family receives baskets of seven dried fruits: almonds, cashewnuts, dried dates, coconut pieces, raisins, dried apricots (khurman) and puffed lotus seeds (phoolmakhana). The tikka ceremony may be combined with the engagement . First, the girl is draped with a chunni (stole), which is usually very ornate. In some families this chunni is a family heirloom, passed down from generation to generation. She is also presented with jewellery, which her mother and sister-in-law help her wear. A tiny dot of henna paste (mehndi) is applied to her palm for good luck, and the function is sealed with the exchange of rings. Everyone present congratulates the couple by feeding them sweets.</p><br>
			
			<div id="sangeet" class="sub_heading">Dholki/sangeet</div>
			<p>There is a sangeet function hosted by the girl's family, in which just a few close members of the boy's family are invited. The girl's family play the dholak drums and sing songs in which they tease the boy and his family. Nowadays people hire DJs and have a dance party followed by dinner. A ladies sangeet is held for the bride and her bridesmaids.</p><br>
			
			<div id="mehndi" class="sub_heading">Mehndi</div>
			<p>The last major function before the wedding is decoration with temporary henna (mehndi) tattoos. Mehndi artists are called to the houses of the boy and girl and apply mehendi to the palms of the female family members, and the hands and feet of the bride. A basket containing Bindi and bangles is handed around so girls can choose those that match the outfit they plan to wear to the wedding. The Mehandi ceremony takes place in the atmosphere of a party. The bride and other ladies get mehendi (henna designs) done, on their hands and feet (most ladies get it done only on their hands but the bride gets it done on both hands and feet). For the bride the mehndi is sent by the future Mother in Law, which is beautifully decorated.</p>

						<b>Kanyadaan</b> and <b>Phere</b> The bride's father puts a ring on the boy's finger and then he gives his daughter to the boy. This ritual is known as the Kanyadaan. It is after the kanyadaan that the pheras begin. The pheras take place in front of the sacred fire-agni. After this the groom applies Sindoor (vermilion) to the girl’s hair partition and the Mangalsutra Rasam takes place where the groom ties a beaded necklace i.e. a mangalsutra to the girl’s neck. When all these rituals are over, the couple gets up to touch the feet of all the elder members in the family and seek their blessings for a happily married life. In a Hindu Punjabi Wedding, Agni (sacred fire) is usually encircled seven times.<br><br>
						In a <a href="#">Sikh wedding</a>, the bride and groom will walk in tow around the Guru Granth Sahib four times, called laavaan. This signifies they not only accept each other as one soul in two bodies, but also as the Guru as the center of their marriage.<br><br>
						Joota chupai It literally means 'hiding the shoes'. The bride’s sisters indulge in stealing of shoes. It is a fun tradition, in which the girls charge a fee for agreeing to return the shoes. They demand Kalecharis of gold for the bride's sisters and of silver for her cousins.<br>
